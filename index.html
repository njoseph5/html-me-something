                 In Israel, it is known as eggplant salad, or Salat Hatzilim. The traditional preparation method is for the eggplant to be baked or broiled over an open flame before peeling, 
                 so that the pulp is soft and has a smoky taste.It is often eaten as a dip with khubz or pita bread, and is sometimes added to other dishes.

                 and creamy béchamel sauce and baked together until golden perfection.The aromatic herbs and spices used in the traditional moussaka recipe penetrate the meat and give a really characteristic 
                 taste and smell which permeates the house, once put in the oven! Let the sauce simmer for a while to allow the flavours to mingle.

                Vindaloo is an Indian curry dish popular in the region of Goa, the surrounding Konkan, and many other parts of India.The cuisine also includes a variation of the dish.
                A "vindaloo", a standard element of Goan cuisine derived from the Portuguese carne de vinha d'alhos (literally "meat in garlic wine marinade"), is a dish of meat (usually pork) marinated in wine and garlic.
                The basic structure of the Portuguese dish was the Portuguese sailor's "preserved" raw ingredients, packed in wooden barrels of alternate layers of pork and garlic, and soaked in wine. 
                This was "Indianized" by the local Goan cooks with the substitution of palm vinegar for the red wine, and the addition of dried red chili peppers with additional spices. It evolved into the localized and easy-to-pronounce dish "vindaloo"

                A tamale (Spanish: tamal, Nahuatl: tamalli)is a traditional Mesoamerican dish made of masa or dough (starchy, and usually corn-based), which is steamed in a corn husk or banana leaf.The Aztec and Maya civilizations, as well as the Olmeca and Tolteca before them, used tamales 
                as easily portable food, for hunting trips, and for traveling large distances, as well as supporting their armies.In Mexico, tamales begin with a dough made from nixtamalized corn (hominy), called masa, or a masa mix, such as Maseca, and lard or vegetable shortening. Tamales 
                are generally wrapped in corn husks or plantain leaves before being steamed, depending on the region from which they come. They usually have a sweet or savory filling and are usually steamed until firm.

                onions, zucchini, eggplant, bell peppers, marjoram, fennel and basil, or bay leaf and thyme, or a mix of green herbs like herbes de Provence.ratatouille does not have a set recipe or precise technique. There are as many versions as there are cooks, each slightly different in method 
                and ingredients.The most traditional recipes call for cooking each vegetable separately in a pot on the stove until well browned, layering everything back into the pot with a generous amount of olive oil and some tomatoes, and then letting it all slowly stew. Most cooks agree that 
                this is the best way to ensure that the vegetables are cooked to perfection before all are combined, and the flavors left to meld.

                A Yule Log or Bûche de Noël (BOOSH duh noh-EHL) is a special dessert for a special occasion - Christmas. This dessert was invented by a French pastry chef in the late 1800s.
                Bo Friberg in his book 'The Professional Pastry Chef' gives us a little history on the Yule Log. He tells us that it was a tradition, dating from pre-Christian times, to honor the God Thor 
                and to celebrate the Winter Solstice with the building of a bonfire. The story goes, that as Christmas came to replace the Winter Solstice celebrations, France carried on the tradition for a 
                'yule' log by cutting down a tree each year and then placing it in the fireplace so the heat from the log could be used to prepare the Christmas Eve midnight supper. The ashes from this 
                'yule' log were believed to hold magical and medicinal powers that would ward off the evil spirits in the coming year. The tradition of substituting a real 'yule' log with a dessert 'Yule' Log (Bûche de Noël) 
                was probably started when homes were built without fireplaces so they could not burn a real 'yule' log.
